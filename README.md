# odin-recipes

## Description

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The website consists of a main landing page with links to specific recipes.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in basic HTML structure, element usage, and file management within a Git workflow. Note that this project uses HTML only, so there is no CSS styling applied.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

1. Git & GitHub: Setting up repositories, cloning, committing changes, and pushing code to a remote repository.

2. HTML Structure: Writing semantic HTML boilerplate, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

3. Text Formatting: Using Header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) and paragraphs to organize content hierarchy.

4. Lists: Implementing ordered lists (`<ol>`) for recipe steps and unordered lists (`<ul>`) for ingredients.

5. Media & Links: Embedding images (`<img>`) and using anchor tags (`<a>`) for absolute and relative links between pages.

6. File Management: Organizing project files into logical directories.
